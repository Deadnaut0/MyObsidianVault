On a Windows system, the primary locations to make changes are the Settings menu and the Control Panel.

For a long time, the Control Panel has been the go-to location to make system changes, such as adding a printer, uninstall a program, etc. 

The Settings menu was introduced in Windows 8, the first Windows operating system catered to touch screen tablets, and is still available in Windows 10. As a matter of fact, the Settings menu is now the primary location a user goes to if they are looking to change the system. 

There are similarities and differences between the two menus. Below are screenshots of each.

Now, if you want to see which applications are installed on the system, click `Programs` button shown here in the control panel. Then select `Programs and Features`. This will list all installed applications along with their names, publishers, and versions. In this way, you can verify any software that has been added to the system. The screenshot below shows the installed applications of another machine through this feature:

**Note** : The icons for Settings might be different in the version of Windows on your personal device. 

Both can be accessed from the Start Menu. See below.

Control Panel is the menu where you will access more complex settings and perform more complex actions. In some cases, you can start in Settings and end up in the Control Panel.

For example, in Settings, click on **Network & Internet** . From here, click on **Change adapter options** .

Notice that the next window that pops up is from the Control Panel.

If you're unclear which to open if you wish to change a setting, use the Start menu and search for it. 

In the example below, the search was 'wallpaper.' Notice that few results were returned.

If we click on the Best match, a window to the Settings menu appears to make changes to the wallpaper.
