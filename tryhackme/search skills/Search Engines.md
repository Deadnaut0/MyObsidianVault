### Search Engines
Every one of us has used an Internet search engine; however, not everyone has tried to harness the full power of an Internet search engine. Almost every Internet search engine allows you to carry out advanced searches. Consider the following examples:

- [Google](https://www.google.com/advanced_search)
- [Bing](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/advanced-search-options-b92e25f1-0085-4271-bdf9-14aaea720930)
- [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/duckduckgo-help-pages/results/syntax/)

Let’s consider the search operators supported by Google.

- `"exact phrase"`: Double quotes indicate that you are looking for pages with the exact word or phrase. For example, one might search for `"passive reconnaissance"` to get pages with this exact phrase.
- `site:`: This operator lets you specify the domain name to which you want to limit your search. For example, we can search for success stories on TryHackMe using `site:tryhackme.com success stories`.
- `-`: The minus sign allows you to omit search results that contain a particular word or phrase. For example, you might be interested in learning about the pyramids, but you don’t want to view tourism websites; one approach is to search for `pyramids -tourism` or `-tourism pyramids`.
- `filetype:`: This search operator is indispensable for finding files instead of web pages. Some of the file types you can search for using Google are Portable Document Format (PDF), Microsoft Word Document (DOC), Microsoft Excel Spreadsheet (XLS), and Microsoft PowerPoint Presentation (PPT). For example, to find cyber security presentations, try searching for `filetype:ppt cyber security`.

You can check more advanced controls in various search engines in this [advanced search operators list](https://github.com/cipher387/Advanced-search-operators-list); however, the above provides a good starting point. Check your favourite search engine for the supported search operators.
