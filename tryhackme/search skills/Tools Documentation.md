## Linux Manual Pages

Long before the Internet was everywhere, how would you get help using a command in a Linux or Unix-like system? The answer would be checking the manual page, man page for short. On Linux and every Unix-like system, each command is expected to have a man page. In fact, man pages also exist for system calls, library functions, and even configuration files.

Let’s say we want to check the manual page for the command `ip`. We issue the command `man ip`. The screenshot below shows the page we received. You might want to start the AttackBox and run `man ip` on the terminal. Press `q` to quit.

If you prefer to read the man page of `ip` in your web browser, just type `man ip` in your favourite search engine. This [page](https://linux.die.net/man/8/ip) might be at the top of the results.

The **AttackBox** is a Linux system accessible from your browser. Clicking on the **Start AttackBox** button will display the AttackBox in a split screen, making it convenient to read the task text and apply the instructions within the same browser window. If you hide the AttackBox window, you can show it again by clicking the blue Show Split View button at the top. In this task, you can start the AttackBox and use it to try Linux commands such as `man`.

## Microsoft Windows

Microsoft provides an official [Technical Documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/) page for its products. The screenshot below shows the search results for the command `ipconfig`.
